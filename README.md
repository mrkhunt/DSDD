## Overview

Using AI to derive business insights from customer feedback. Leveraging the available data from Scotiabank, our focus was on extracting valuable insights to refine the customer journey and address pertinent business inquiries.

## Background

In today's digital age, customer feedback serves as a crucial barometer for the success and user satisfaction of mobile and online applications, particularly for financial institutions. Analyzing customer app review is integral to enhancing the customer experience. These reviews offer a wealth of unstructured feedback directly from the end users, providing invaluable insights into customer satisfaction, usability issues, and desired features. By meticulously examining these comments, financial institutions can identify recurring issues, understand customer sentiment, and gauge the effectiveness of new features. Furthermore, this analysis not only helps in fine-tuning the app's features but also demonstrates a commitment to listening to customer needs, thereby fostering loyalty and trust. This feedback loop is vital in a competitive market where user experience can significantly influence customer retention and acquisition. In the competitive financial sector, where digital convenience and reliability are paramount, leveraging such customer feedback is essential for staying ahead and ensuring a seamless, positive user experience.
